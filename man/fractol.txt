*** TIPS ***


- mlx_hook :
	Example for Linux :
		mlx_hook(conf->win_ptr, KeyPress, KeyPressMask, ft_press_key, conf);
	Linux masks used :
		KeyPress       (2) | KeyPressMask         (1L<<0)
		ButtonPress    (4) | ButtonPressMask      (1L<<2)
		ButtonPress    (5) | ButtonReleaseMask    (1L<<3)
		MotionNotify   (6) | PointerMotionMask    (1L<<6)
		FocusIn        (9) | FocusChangeMask     (1L<<21)
		Expose        (12) | ExposureMask        (1L<<15)
		DestroyNotify (17) | StructureNotifyMask (1L<<17)
	For additional Linux masks, see :
		X11/Xlib.h
		http://refspecs.linuxfoundation.org/LSB_1.3.0/gLSB/gLSB/libx11-ddefs.html

- DestroyNotify fix (Linux only) :
	There seems to be a bug with this specific version of MinilibX-linux.
	Indeed, DestroyNotify, has to be set to "33" to work properly.
	It is normally defined to "17" by Xlib standard (see mlx_hook for mor details).

- Mac OS Install (fix keyboard) :
	Before to compile, open the file "Makefile".
		Replace the line 37 : "minilibx-macos" instead of "minilibx-linux".
		Replace the line 102 : "keys_macos.h" instead of "keyx_linux.h"
		Replace all the line 112 with :
			LBX_FLAGS = -L$(LIB_PATH)/minilibx-macos -lmlx -framework OpenGL -framework AppKit
	Then, open the file "/include/fractol.h".
		Replace the line 25 : "keys_macos.h" instead of "keys_linux.h".
	Finally, open the file "/src/ft_start_hook.c".
		Remove all the Linux masks and replace with '0'.
			See the "mlx_hook" part above for more details.
			Example for Mac Os :
				mlx_hook(conf->win_ptr, KeyPress, 0, ft_press_key, conf);
	 Now, compile normally the program with the command "make".
	 The keyboard and mouse events will now work properly.

- Mac OS Install (fix 'X11/Xlib.h' missing)
	Install XQuartz to get the 'X11 lib' on Mac OS.
		https://www.xquartz.org/
	Then create a symbolic link as below :
		ln -s /opt/X11/include/X11 /usr/local/include/X11
	Now, compile normally the program with the command "make".

- Mac OS Install (fix unknown type as 't_xvar')
	Before to compile, open the file "/include/structs.h".
		Replace the line 190 : "void" instead of "t_xvar".
	Then, open the file "/src/ft_end.c".
		Comment the line 85 as following : "//XCloseDisplay(conf->mlx_ptr->display);"
	Now, compile normally the program with the command "make".

- mlx_get_data_addr :
	bpp    = bits per pixels
	size_l = nb bytes used to store one line in memory
	endian = little endian (0) or big endian (1)

- Buddhabrot :
	Go to Buddhabrot fractal (fractal number 5).
	 Increase the imax value (key PAGE_UP) to get better results.
	 Increase the filter value (key MAJ_RIGHT) to get darker contrast.
	Explanation :
	 Buddhabrot fractal is calculated in the same way than Mandelbrot.
	 But the visualization of the datas is different.
	 With Mandelbrot, a pixel color depends only of the value of its iteration max.
	 With Buddhabrot, there is a counter for each pixel.
	 A pixel counter is increased each time that its corresponding pixel is visited during the iteration process.
	 So there are many more pixels taken into account.
	 With a high number of iteration max, the fractal take the form of "Buddha".


- Nebulabrot :
	Go to Buddhabrot fractal (fractal number 5).
	 Switch to NASA Color Mode (key SPACE, Special Color Mode number 4).
	 Increase the value of Sample (Key INSER) to get better results.
	 Decrease the value of Level (key END) if the colors start to be slobbery.
	 Increase the value of anti-alliasing (SSAA) (key A) to get incredible results.
	Explanation :
	 To transform a Buddhabrot to Nebulabrot and get an astronomy picture effect, the same technique than NASA is used.
	 The technical is called False-Color Imaging.
	 It consists to make a radiography of an object, like a galaxy, at different frequency.
	 Here, the fractal replace the galaxy and the iteration max replace the frequency.
	 The default value of iteration max is used for Blue, then multiplied by 10 for Green, then multiplied by 100 for Red.

	Example :
	 Red (Imax = 3200) - Green (Imax = 320) - Blue (Imax = 32)

- 3D Fractals :
  	You can visualize fractal in 3D Isometric with an other program called "Fil de Fer".
 	 This program has been made by the same autor.
	First, generate a FdF file with option [-w] or the key [W].
	 The file is created at the root of the fractol folder.
	 The filename includes the name of the fractal, then the date and the time of the file creation.
	Then, start the "fdf" program followed by the path of the file newly created.
  	 Use "./fdf -h" for more details.

- Split your terminal and start a new fractol instance to visualize various fractals at the same time.

- Press "[CMD] + [C]" in the terminal to force quit in case of emergency.

- For other issue or additionnal request, please contact the support team (see "auteur" file).
